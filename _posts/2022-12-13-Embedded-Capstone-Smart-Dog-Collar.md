For my second capstone, my team created a smart dog collar which monitors the temperature of a dog, and alerts the owner via a mobile application if their dog is in danger. For this project, we developed the device on the arduino platform and the mobile application for arduino devices. Additionally, we created a custom flex pcb to house all the devices.
