For the final project of EE 371: Design of Digigal Circuits and Systems, we were given free reign to design whatever project we wanted using SystemVerilog and a DE1 SoC board. My partner and I decided on creating a multi-level maze game where the user would control a character and try to get to the end of the game. The following are some screenshots from our game as well as a live demo.
