My capstone is through the ENGINE program at the UW ECE which pairs students with projects from companies, labs and research groups. I was paired with UW CSE's [Octopus Research Group](http://arl.cs.washington.edu/ORG/) with the goal of creating a VR experience to create empathy towards octopi. To do this, our team worked with the Unity game engine and created C# scripts, shaders, and animations. A link to the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/TStrong85/OctopusVR). 


Due to the diverse requirements, our team split the project into a plethora of distict portions that were complete on their own. This project is still ongoing and the following sections go over the work I have completed:

## Reaching Into and Exploring Opening
 ---
 
The first major task I was assigned was to get the octopus arms to be able to reach inside and explore openings. Due to my initial lack of experience in both AI and Unity, I started out creating a simple AI model before moving onto the the working with the octopus model. The AI I ended up created is a model that searches for an door opening. The follow shows the an example of the model searching for a door opening.

To explore its surroundings, the AI finds a random point within a certain walking range, moves the that point, and repeats indefintiely. However, I soon realized that having purely random exploring leads the AI to meander and have sparatic pathing. I order to combat that, the AI remembers the three previous walk points (which are displayed as the yellow spheres), and ensures that the next walk point (displayed as a red sphere), is not within their radius.

In order for the AI to be able to find the door opening, I placed "checkpoints" around the house that allow the AI to know where it currently is. Once the AI is withing range of a given region, it moves inside that region where it cannot leave until it finds the next checkpoint. The checkpoints are shown below.

After completing this AI model, I began working on the tentacles. There was existing scripts which attracted the tentacles to a specfic point which I used as the baseline driver of the tentacle movement; however, I modified and added more functionality so that they fit my needs. From there, I modified the existing framework I had worked out with my previous AI model onto a jar. The following shows the checkpoints I defined for a jar.

From there, I defined the behavior I wanted a tentacle is in a specific region and the results are as follows.
