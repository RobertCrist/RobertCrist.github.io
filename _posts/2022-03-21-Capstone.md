My capstone is through the ENGINE program at the UW ECE which pairs students with projects from companies, labs and research groups. I was paired with UW CSE's [Octopus Research Group](http://arl.cs.washington.edu/ORG/) with the goal of creating a VR experience to create empathy towards octopi. To do this, our team worked with the Unity game engine and created C# scripts, shaders, and animations. A link to the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/TStrong85/OctopusVR). 


Due to the diverse requirements, our team split the project into a plethora of distict portions that were complete on their own. This project is still ongoing and the following sections go over the work I have completed:

## Reaching Into and Exploring Opening
 ---
 
The first major task I was assigned was to get the octopus arms to be able to reach inside and explore openings. Due to my initial lack of experience in both AI and Unity, I started out creating a simple AI model before moving onto the the working with the octopus model. The AI I ended up created is a model that searches for an door opening. The follow shows the an example of the model searching for a door opening.
