I am an undergraduate student at the University of Washington studying Electrical Engineering with a focus on embedded systems.

Currently, I am working on my capstone as part of the ENGINE program with the UW CSE [Octopus Research Group](http://arl.cs.washington.edu/ORG/).

Outside of academics, Robert likes to spend his time rock climbing in both indoor gyms as well as outdoors in places like Little Si, Leavenworth, and Smith Rock.
