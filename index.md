I am an undergraduate student at the University of Washington studying Electrical Engineering with a focus on embedded systems.

Currently, working towards finishing my undergraduate degree and seeking an intership in the Seattle area.

Outside of academics, Robert likes to spend his time rock climbing in both indoor gyms as well as outdoors in places like Little Si, Leavenworth, and Smith Rock.
